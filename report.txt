NOTE TO TEACHER:
- Function advance_time in advance_time.py only added to fit the requirement in the assignment, not used in my code
- Writing result of turnover function from turnover.py to .txt file only there to fulfill requirement, no practical use

Technical points:

1. I thought it was important to add functionality to the sell function to make it impossible to store a product as sold (i.e. to sell it) if it's not in the inventory or not available in sufficient amount.
   To solve this I added the helper function check_inventory(), the result of this helper (a list of inventory listings) is stored to a variable called inventory.
   The first problem (product not in inventory) I solved by defining a variable Found = False, looping over each item in inventory to see if product is in there and changing Found to True if so and executing the rest.
   The second problem (cannot sell more of product than in inventory) I solved by adding a counter that counts the number of times an item in inventory contains the product and stores this number.
   I could then compare the amount to be sold to the count in inventory, if the amount <= the count the sell function is executed. If not, an error message is displayed detailing the maximum number of this product that can be sold. 

   found = False
   count = 0

   for list_item in inventory:
        if prod_name in list_item:
            count += 1
            found = True
   if found == True:
        if amount <= count:
            for number in range(amount):
                old_id = new_product_dict["product_id"]
                new_id = old_id + 1
                new_product_dict["product_id"] = new_id

                bought_id = find_product_id(prod_name, "bought.csv", (number + 1))

                new_product_dict["bought_id"] = bought_id

                write_to_sold(new_product_dict)
            print(f"Product sold succesfully!")
        else:
            print(f"Amount exceeds product count in inventory! You can currently sell {count} of {prod_name}.")

    else:
        print(f"Product {prod_name} not in inventory!")

2. I also coded the sell function so that time-travel shopping is not possible. Via the check_inventory function in the sell function, the inventory of the **current date** is returned, making it impossible to go back in time and sell products that were sold on a later date.
   inventory = check_inventory(current_date, prod_name) 

2. I decided that the inventory should only reflect those products fit to be sold, i.e. expired products are not in the inventory.
   Therefore, each time the report inventory function get_inventory() is called, the helper function in it called get_expired() filters out the expired products from the result.
   The report profit also uses get_expired() to subtract the sum of all expired products from the profit. The get_expired functions takes the latest date passed into the parent function to reflect inventory, profit or turnover correctly for the given timeframe.

3. in the code of profit.py i used an early return to correctly execute the rather complicated nested if-else and for loops, it would not function properly without it so I'm glad I discovered it!
